Functions and Events in JS
Functions are building blocks in JS
Function-It is a set of statements that perform a specific task or do some computation 
Functions make JS more readable, organised , reusable and maintainable.

Ways to write Functionsn
1.Function Declaration
2.Function Expression
3.Array Functions
4.Generator Functions
5.Async Functions
6.Anonymous Functions
7.Construction Functions

1.Function Declaraions or Named Functions
    They are the most common type of function in JS
    They are defined by using Fn keyword followed by fn name and a set of parameters

    Syntax:
        function theFunctionName(list of parameters){
            The JS Code.
        }
    Passing parameters
        parameters provide functions with input
        Implicitly declared variables that can be accessed by code within function bode
        You can provide actual input values when you call the function
        parameters are named variables separated by commas
            Eg: function myFunction(n,m)
        
Event Handling
    Events are the actions that occur as the result of browser activity or user interactions with the webpages.
        Such as the the user performs a actions
        USer clicks on the link in a page
        etc...
    You can detect when certain things happen
    Event handlinhs is a mechanism that controls the event and decides what shouls happen if an event ouucurs.This mechanism have the code which is knowm as event handeler that is executed when an event occurs
    There are three parts:
        Event source- GUI component with which user interactions
        Event object- Type of the event that occurred
                    source of the event
                    TIme of the event
        Event listener- Receives event object when notified, then responds
    
    Ways of using JS events 
        1.Inline/HTML event handlers
        2.addEventListener()
        3.removeEventListener()
        4.Traditional event handlers

        1.Inline or HTML event handlers
            This is a bad practice, it is always better to seperate the JS from HTML
            The attribute name matches the event names; their value calls the functoins linked to that event .The syntax to recognise an event handler looks like:
                <{HTMLtag} {eventhandler}={JS Code}>
